# LaserChessEngine
Hi! This program is an engine designed to help you find the best move in any position of ThinkFun's Laser Chess. I have no affiliation with ThinkFun.

## Info
* **IDE** - Visual Studio 2019 (Recommended if you want to clone and work on this repo)
* **Language** - C++
* **Projects**:
    * **LaserChessEngine** - The library containing all the functionality (so far) of the engine
    * **LaserChessEngineExec** - The interface that allows you to use the engine (more details later)
    * **LaserChessEngineTest** - Test cases I wrote to help ensure the engine works properly (Google Test)
